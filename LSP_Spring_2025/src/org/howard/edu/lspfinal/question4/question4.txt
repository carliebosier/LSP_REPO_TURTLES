Question 4:

In our introduction to design patterns, we learned that design patterns can be very useful in certain scenarios  like creating recyclable code and solutions, but there is a down side with using design patterns.  Sometimes using a design pattern can lead to a more complex pattern to an overall simple  problem. Because there isnâ€™t a standardized system for indexing or organizing patterns that all developers follow, the lack of standardized structure can make it hard for teams of software developers to make a single decision in developing a single, clear architecture. This is why most developers live by the KISS, also known as, keep it simple stupid.
